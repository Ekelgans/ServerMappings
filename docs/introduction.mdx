# Introduction

Server Mappings is a collection of mappings for Minecraft servers, including the most popular servers such as Hypixel, Mineplex, and more. 
Server Mappings provides information such as server name, server icon and more. 
It is used by Lunar Client to hydrate server information in places such as the server list within the launcher and the friends list within the client.

Previously this informtion was handled internally and server owners had no god way to manage this information for their servers. 
Since the creation of this repository, hundereds of servers and detailed information for them, has been added.

This documentation will provide you with all information you'll need to know to add your server and harness the power of Server Mappings. We'll cover how to add your server and what information can be gathered from this repository and how.
