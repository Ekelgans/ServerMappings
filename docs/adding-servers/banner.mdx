# Server Banner

Some servers may also provide a server banner. If it is required for your server, please take note of the following guidelines:

- If a static banner is provided, it should be uploaded as a `.png` version named `banner.png`.
- If an animated banner is provided, it should be uploaded as a `.gif` version named `banner.gif`.
- The banner should represent the content of the server and prominently feature the server's name and/or IP.
- All banners must have a minimum width of 340 pixels and a height of 45 pixels, resulting in a 68:9 aspect ratio.
- Animated (GIF) banners should play at a speed of 20 frames per second and should not exceed a duration of 10 seconds.

Please ensure that your server banner meets these requirements. As with other assets, the server banner will be reviewed before being accepted.
