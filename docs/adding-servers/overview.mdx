# Overview

### Creating an ID for your server

When adding your server to Server Mappings you should create a subfolder within the `servers` folder. This folder should be named after your server in the form of an "ID". 

When creating the ID for your server you should bare in mind the following things, your ID must:
- Be unique, no other servers should have the same ID
- Be short and concise, it should be similar to the name of your server
- Be alphanumeric, no special characters should be used

### Creating the nessessary files

Your servers' folder must contain the following files:
- `metadata.json` [(docs)](/server-mappings/adding-servers/metadata.md)
- `logo.png` [(docs)](/server-mappings/adding-servers/logo.md)
- `background.png` [(docs)](/server-mappings/adding-servers/background.md)

_To read more about each file within the folder please read their respective documentation._
